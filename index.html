        <P>Happy Easter Sunday 2021 Wishes Images, Messages, Status: A day celebrated across the globe, Easter Sunday marks the resurrection of Jesus. This day occurs three days after Jesus was crucified. While Easter falls differently every year, this year it will be celebrated on April 4, 2021. An important day marked in the Christian calendar, this day celebrates Jesusâ€™ victory over death. On this day, people observe fast and visit the church with their loved ones. While this might be a popular belief, Easter was not always celebrated like this. This is because until the Saxons were converted to Christians, the day honoured Eastre who was the pagan Saxon goddess.
